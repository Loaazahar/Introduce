Hello! Welcome.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>My Name is Loaa Zahar, and This is my Welcome Seminar. </p><!-- slightdelayhere-->
<p>My Name is Loaa Zahar, and I am a MSc degree holder in Robotics Control and I used to be a Teaching Assistant for the past four years in the German University in Cairo.</p><!-- slightdelayhere-->
<p> My Research Experiences can be divided into four categories,<!-- slightdelayhere--><!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --> which all fall under the umbrella of the Motion Control of Magento Robotic Sperms. <!-- slightdelayhere-->
Fabrication of Microrobots, Frequency Response characterization for motion analysis and control coefficents<!-- slightdelayhere--><!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --> open and closed loop systems for motion control and Post MSc work </p><!-- slightdelayhere-->

<p> The Sperm shaped-like microrobot has been first introduced by Khalil et al in 2016.<!-- slightdelayhere--><!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --> Another version has been introduced in 2017 due to application purposes. 
<p> The microrobot on the left has a problem with changing its direction of propagation; and since the intendent application is a drug delivery application<!-- slightdelayhere--><!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --> there are no big space for the microrobot to change its direction of propagation.</p>
<p> The picture on the left describes the two-tailed Microrobotic sperm which is the first version with extra tail in the opposite direction to the first tail. <!-- slightdelayhere--><!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --> Depending on the ratio between the tailâ€™s length, under certain actuation frequencies, the microrobot changes its direction of propagation. 
<p> The two tails produce frequency dependent forces and the microrobot will propagate in the direction of the stronger force. <!-- slightdelayhere--><!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --> We have found 5 main tail length ratio groups as you can see. Three out of the five groups can change the microrobot direction of propagation.
The fabrication process is called electrospinning process. We solidify a solution of polystyrene in Dimethylformamide and iron nanoparticles under a high electric field between 15 and 25 KV and needle flow rate of 20 microliter/min.  <!-- slightdelayhere--><!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --> The Resulting magnetic fibers are then handled under magnification of 5x to extract the desired microrobots, whether single or two-tailed microrobots.</p>
